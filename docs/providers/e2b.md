# E2B Provider

Read when:

- choosing `provider: e2b`;
- configuring E2B templates, sandbox users, or workdirs;
- changing `internal/providers/e2b`.

E2B is a delegated-run provider. Crabbox uses E2B's platform API for sandbox
lifecycle (`POST /sandboxes`, `POST /sandboxes/{sandboxID}/connect`,
`GET /v2/sandboxes`, `GET /sandboxes/{sandboxID}`, and
`DELETE /sandboxes/{sandboxID}`) and the per-sandbox `envd` APIs for file upload
and command execution (`POST /files` and `POST /process.Process/Start`). E2B
owns sandbox state and process transport; Crabbox owns local config, repo claims,
sync manifests and guardrails, slugs, timing summaries, and normalized
`list`/`status` rendering. There is no Crabbox SSH lease and no broker
coordinator; the CLI talks to E2B directly.

## When to use

Use E2B when the remote Linux sandbox should be owned by E2B and commands should
run through E2B's file/process APIs. Choose AWS, Hetzner, Static SSH, or Daytona
instead when you need direct SSH access to the box.

E2B is Linux-only. Desktop, browser, code, Actions hydration, and SSH-based run
options are not available.

## Commands

```sh
crabbox warmup --provider e2b --e2b-template base
crabbox run --provider e2b -- pnpm test
crabbox run --provider e2b --id swift-crab --shell 'pnpm install && pnpm test'
crabbox status --provider e2b --id swift-crab --wait
crabbox stop --provider e2b swift-crab
crabbox list --provider e2b --json
```

`warmup` always keeps the sandbox until an explicit `stop`. The lease ID, slug,
or E2B sandbox ID printed by `warmup`/`run` can be passed to later commands via
`--id`.

## Auth

```sh
export E2B_API_KEY=e2b_...
```

`CRABBOX_E2B_API_KEY` is also accepted and takes precedence over `E2B_API_KEY`.
Do not pass the key as a command-line argument.

E2B access tokens are not used by Crabbox. E2B's current docs mark
`E2B_ACCESS_TOKEN` as deprecated for SDK/API use; configure `E2B_API_KEY` instead.

Endpoint overrides:

- `CRABBOX_E2B_API_URL` / `E2B_API_URL` or `e2b.apiUrl` override the default API
  URL `https://api.e2b.app`. Overrides must use HTTPS; plain HTTP is accepted
  only for localhost or loopback development endpoints.
- `CRABBOX_E2B_DOMAIN` / `E2B_DOMAIN` or `e2b.domain` override the sandbox
  hostname suffix used for envd and preview URLs. The default is `e2b.app`, which
  makes envd URLs look like `https://49983-<sandbox-id>.e2b.app/...`. This is an
  advanced self-hosted or development override; pass only a hostname, not a URL.

## Config

```yaml
provider: e2b
target: linux
e2b:
  apiUrl: https://api.e2b.app
  domain: e2b.app # advanced: hostname suffix, not a URL
  template: base
  workdir: crabbox
  user: ""
```

Provider flags (each overrides the matching `e2b.*` config key):

```text
--e2b-api-url
--e2b-domain
--e2b-template
--e2b-workdir
--e2b-user
```

`template` also reads `CRABBOX_E2B_TEMPLATE`, `workdir` reads
`CRABBOX_E2B_WORKDIR`, and `user` reads `CRABBOX_E2B_USER`.

### Workdir and user resolution

A relative `e2b.workdir` resolves inside the selected E2B user's home: the
default user home is `/home/user`, `user: ubuntu` resolves under `/home/ubuntu`,
and `user: root` resolves under `/root`. An absolute `workdir` is used as-is.

`e2b.user` must be a login name, not a path. Values containing `/`, `\`, `.`,
`..`, or a null byte (for example `../tmp` or `team/dev`) are rejected before any
sandbox or process call.

The resolved workdir must be a dedicated subdirectory. Broad system roots such as
`/`, `/home`, `/tmp`, `/root`, `/usr`, `/var`, `/etc`, and similar are rejected
before sandbox creation and before any sync that creates, deletes, or extracts
files.

## Lifecycle

1. Create or resolve a Crabbox-owned E2B sandbox from `e2b.template` (default
   `base`), with secure envd access and internet access enabled.
2. Store Crabbox metadata on the sandbox and write a local repo claim.
3. Build the Crabbox sync manifest, upload a gzipped archive into `/tmp`, and
   extract it into the resolved workdir through envd.
4. Execute `/bin/bash -l -c <command>` through the E2B process stream in that
   workdir.
5. Delete the sandbox on release unless the lease is kept.

E2B caps sandbox timeouts at one hour. Crabbox clamps a longer local lease TTL to
that limit when creating or connecting to a sandbox, and a TTL of zero falls back
to five minutes.

## Capabilities

- SSH: no.
- Crabbox sync: yes, archive sync through E2B envd file and process APIs.
- Desktop / browser / code: no.
- Actions hydration: no.
- Coordinator (broker): no — always direct from the CLI.

## Live smoke

Run a live smoke when changing E2B lifecycle, sync, status, or process-stream
code. Keep the API key in the environment; never pass it as an argument.

```sh
export E2B_API_KEY=e2b_...
go build -trimpath -o bin/crabbox ./cmd/crabbox
CRABBOX_LIVE=1 \
CRABBOX_LIVE_PROVIDERS=e2b \
CRABBOX_LIVE_REPO=/path/to/my-app \
scripts/live-smoke.sh
```

The shared harness exits before any E2B `warmup`, `status`, `run`, `list`, or
`stop` command when no API key is exported. With the key configured, it creates
one E2B sandbox from the selected template, waits for readiness, runs one
no-sync command, lists normalized E2B inventory, and stops the lease.

For manual debugging, run the same lifecycle directly:

```sh
export E2B_API_KEY=e2b_...
go build -trimpath -o bin/crabbox ./cmd/crabbox

bin/crabbox warmup --provider e2b --e2b-template base --timing-json
lease=<slug-or-cbx_id-from-warmup-output>

bin/crabbox status --provider e2b --id "$lease" --wait
bin/crabbox run --provider e2b --id "$lease" --no-sync -- echo crabbox-e2b-ok
bin/crabbox stop --provider e2b "$lease"
bin/crabbox list --provider e2b --json
```

Expected results:

- `warmup` prints `provider=e2b`, the Crabbox lease ID, slug, and E2B sandbox ID.
- `status --wait` reports the sandbox as ready.
- The no-sync run prints `crabbox-e2b-ok`.
- `stop` deletes the sandbox and removes the local lease claim.
- The final `list` shows no Crabbox-owned sandbox remaining.

## Gotchas

- `--id` accepts a Crabbox slug, a `cbx_...` lease ID, or an E2B sandbox ID in
  raw or `e2b_<sandboxID>` form. Raw and synthetic sandbox IDs are honored only
  when the sandbox metadata marks it as Crabbox-owned.
- `--class` and `--type` are rejected; the E2B template owns sandbox resources.
- `--checksum` is rejected because there is no Crabbox SSH/rsync target. Large-
  sync preflight guardrails still apply.
- Because E2B does not declare archive-sync as a generic feature, the shared
  delegated guards reject `--sync-only` and `--force-sync-large`, along with
  `--full-resync`, `--script`/`--script-stdin`, `--fresh-pr`, `--env-helper`,
  local stdout/stderr captures (`--capture-stdout`, `--capture-stderr`,
  `--capture-on-fail`), `--download`, `--artifact-glob`, `--require-artifact`,
  `--emit-proof`, and `--stop-after`. Crabbox owns command transport for E2B and
  has no SSH target for those paths.
- `--keep-on-failure` keeps a newly created sandbox after a failed command
  instead of deleting it, subject to the one-hour sandbox timeout.
- To prove cleanup in a smoke, run `crabbox list --provider e2b --json` after a
  `stop` or a non-kept run and confirm no Crabbox-owned sandbox remains.
