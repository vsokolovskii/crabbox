# Provider Landscape

Read when:

- comparing Crabbox with adjacent sandbox, dev-environment, or microVM tools;
- deciding whether a competitor should become a first-class provider;
- planning provider capability work without live provider credentials.

This is a product and architecture map, not a benchmark. External products move
quickly, so use this page to decide the next Crabbox seam to harden, then verify
current behavior against the provider docs before adding code.

## Core Position

Crabbox should own the provider-neutral contract: selecting a target, syncing a
checkout, running commands, returning proof, exposing reachability, and cleaning
up capacity. It should not copy every adjacent product's control plane.

That means:

- support stable execution substrates as providers;
- expose shared workflow capabilities through `crabbox providers` and
  `crabbox providers recommend`;
- keep runtime-shape labels provider-neutral (`managed-sandbox`,
  `delegated-command`, `ssh-host`, `worker-module`) instead of copying one
  vendor's control-plane terms;
- keep reachability labels provider-neutral (`provider-url`, `ssh-tunnel`,
  `tailnet-peer`, `tailnet-egress`) so preview URL, tailnet, and SSH tunnel
  workflows can be compared without provider-specific docs scraping;
- use `ssh` or `external` for tools that already produce a normal host contract;
- defer first-class support for runtimes whose useful behavior is still too
  product-specific to test offline.

## Landscape

| Segment | External systems | Crabbox fit today | Improve next |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CI proof runners | Blacksmith Testbox, Semaphore, GitHub Actions-style runners | Strong fit. Crabbox already separates proof-runner semantics from generic VM semantics through `ci-proof-runner` providers and `providers recommend ci-proof`. | Keep run proof, artifacts, downloads, and status records normalized across providers. |
| Hosted agent sandboxes | E2B, Vercel Sandbox, Modal Sandboxes, Cloudflare Sandbox SDK, OpenSandbox, smolvm, Upstash Box | Good fit when the provider owns process execution and files. These map to `delegated-run` better than SSH leases. | Improve artifact/download parity, preview URL reporting, timeout/error taxonomy, and optional MCP attachment routing. |
| Remote developer environments | Coder, Daytona, Namespace Devbox, CodeSandbox, Morph, OpenComputer, Codespaces-like tools | Good fit when Crabbox can either SSH into the workspace or delegate a command with archive sync. `providers recommend remote-dev` is the routing surface. | Add clearer live smoke docs per provider, surface pause/resume support, and keep local-editor, remote-compute flows distinct from CI proof. |
| Forkable/versioned workspaces | Mitos, Firecracker snapshot systems, local-container, Parallels | Partial fit. Crabbox already has provider-neutral checkpoint/fork/restore capability names and checkpoint fan-out via `checkpoint fork --count`, but only local providers advertise the fast path today. | Harden `versioned-workspace` behavior before adding any runtime-specific fork API. Do not add Mitos-only flags. |
| Worker and module runtimes | Cloudflare Dynamic Workers, Cloudflare Sandbox SDK, Vercel/edge-adjacent runtimes | Narrow fit. `cloudflare-dynamic-workers` is a module-run provider; generic container sandboxes need a separate lifecycle and file/process contract. | Keep worker-runtime separate from Linux sandbox execution unless the provider can expose files, process status, logs, preview URLs, and cleanup. |
| Self-hosted virtualization | Proxmox, XCP-ng, Incus, KubeVirt, local VMs | Strong fit when Crabbox gets a normal SSH lease and lifecycle hooks. | Keep provider-specific reconciliation behind adapters; no provider-specific branching in core. |
| GPU and ML execution | RunPod, NVIDIA Brev, W&B, Modal, cloud GPU VMs | Mixed fit. SSH leases are best for debugging; delegated providers are best for provider-owned jobs. | Normalize result evidence and cost/usage metadata before chasing more GPU-specific launch paths. |

## Mitos Decision

Do not add first-class Mitos support yet.

Mitos is strategically interesting because it targets forkable Firecracker
microVM swarms, MCP, and copy-on-write fan-out from a warm running machine. That
is a different contract from most Crabbox providers. If Crabbox adds `mitos`
today, the likely failure mode is ugly: Mitos-specific flags, Kubernetes and KVM
assumptions leaking into core, and tests that cannot prove the useful behavior
without a live cluster.

The better path is to make the generic seams real first:

- `workspace-checkpoint`, `workspace-fork`, `workspace-restore`, and
  `provider-snapshot` keep forkable workspace language provider-neutral.
- `runtime` filter values like `managed-sandbox`, `delegated-command`, and
  `worker-module` describe the execution shape without implying Mitos-style
  live microVM forking.
- `mcp-attachments` stays a capability, not a Mitos-only command mode.
- `run-proof`, `run-artifacts`, `run-downloads`, and `url-bridge` keep evidence
  portable across delegated sandboxes and proof runners.
- `lifecycle` filter values like `cleanup`, `pause-resume`, `run-session`,
  `workspace-state`, and `coordinator-governed` expose stateful sandbox and
  devbox controls without baking in one provider's lifecycle API.
- `reachability` filter values describe access planes without claiming a
  provider-specific network isolation model.
- `remote-dev`, `mcp-sandbox`, `isolated-execution`, and
  `versioned-workspace` keep recommendations workflow-oriented.
- `fanout-testing` and its `best-of-n` alias route operators to existing
  fork-capable providers without adding a Mitos-only live-fork API.
- `checkpoint fork --count` covers ordinary parallel attempts against archive
  and native checkpoints while keeping live memory-forking as a future provider
  optimization, not a core CLI assumption.

Revisit Mitos only when there is a concrete use case that needs live microVM
forking and the provider contract can be tested with offline unit coverage plus
an opt-in live smoke. Until then, document it as an observed adjacent system.

## Support Matrix

| System | Support stance | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mitos | Observe, do not support directly yet. | Its main differentiator is live microVM forking. Crabbox needs generic fork/checkpoint semantics hardened before a Mitos adapter would be clean. |
| E2B | Supported as `e2b`. | Delegated sandbox execution maps cleanly to provider-owned sessions, envd file/process APIs, and URL bridge behavior. |
| Vercel Sandbox | Supported as `vercel-sandbox`. | Ephemeral Linux sandbox execution fits `delegated-run`; keep adding evidence and artifact parity before more surface area. |
| Modal | Supported as `modal`. | Provider-owned container execution fits delegated runs, especially Python and ML-shaped workloads. |
| Cloudflare Sandbox SDK | Candidate, not the same as current Cloudflare providers. | The SDK can be a good delegated-run backend if the lifecycle, file, process, preview, and cleanup contract is stable enough. |
| Cloudflare Dynamic Workers | Supported as `cloudflare-dynamic-workers`. | Worker/module execution is a separate target from Linux sandbox execution. |
| Daytona | Supported as `daytona`. | Managed dev environment with SSH-shaped execution fits remote-dev routing. |
| Namespace Devbox | Supported as `namespace-devbox`. | SSH lease plus sync/cleanup behavior fits remote-dev routing. |
| CodeSandbox | Supported as `codesandbox`. | Delegated workspace execution and pause/resume fit remote-dev routing. |
| Morph | Supported as `morph`. | Managed SSH lease fits local-editor, remote-compute workflows. |
| OpenComputer | Supported as `opencomputer`. | Delegated Linux execution fits remote-dev and sandbox routing, but evidence parity should improve. |
| DevPod | Do not support directly. | It is already a provider-agnostic dev environment layer. Use the resulting SSH/container target through `ssh`, `local-container`, or `external`. |
| Coder | Supported as `coder`. | The built-in contract is intentionally narrow: local Coder CLI auth, Linux SSH proxy execution, stop-by-default release, delete only by opt-in, and cleanup only for locally claimed workspaces. Use `ssh` or `external` for existing workspaces that Crabbox should not manage. |
| Kubernetes Agent Sandbox | Supported as `agent-sandbox`. | SandboxClaim-style delegated execution belongs behind the existing Kubernetes-native adapter. |
| OpenSandbox, Microsandbox, Moru-like runtimes | Candidate only. | Add only when one has a stable lifecycle and evidence contract that is meaningfully different from existing delegated sandboxes. |

## Roadmap

Ship these in small PRs:

1. Keep recommendation surfaces workflow-first.
   `ci-proof`, `run-evidence`, `fast-feedback`, `isolated-execution`,
   `mcp-sandbox`, `remote-dev`, `team-cloud`, and `versioned-workspace` should
   stay the public routing vocabulary.
2. Improve evidence parity for delegated sandboxes.
   The biggest practical gap versus hosted sandbox products is not launch; it is
   consistent proof, artifacts, downloads, preview URLs, logs, and error status.
   Use `crabbox providers recommend run-session` when the workflow needs a
   reusable provider session handle for later inspection.
   Use `crabbox providers recommend artifact-download` when a workflow needs
   retained files or downloadable results from provider-owned execution.
   Use `crabbox providers recommend failure-diagnostics` when failed-run triage
   needs proof, reusable sessions, retained outputs, preview URLs, or SSH access
   to a synced checkout.
   Use `crabbox providers recommend interactive-debug` when triage needs a live
   inspection surface such as synced SSH, browser/code/desktop access, reusable
   sessions, provider URLs, or retained evidence after the debug session.
   Use `crabbox providers recommend preview-url` when the workflow specifically
   needs provider-native app or service URLs.
   Use `crabbox providers --reachability provider-url` or
   `crabbox providers recommend reachability --reachability tailnet-peer` when
   the operator needs an explicit access plane.
   Use `crabbox providers recommend network-isolation` when the workflow runs
   untrusted code and network exposure should stay inside a delegated or local
   sandbox boundary.
   Use `crabbox providers recommend resource-observability` when the workflow
   needs coordinator usage/cost visibility, SSH resource telemetry, retained run
   evidence, reusable sessions, or preview URLs for later inspection.
   Use `crabbox providers recommend code-interpreter` when generated-code or
   script execution should prefer delegated or local sandboxes with sessions,
   archive sync, retained outputs, preview URLs, MCP attachments, or module
   execution.
   Use `crabbox providers recommend disposable-execution` when temporary
   workloads should prefer cleanup-capable delegated or local sandboxes before
   retaining only the proof, outputs, session, or preview metadata needed for
   inspection.
   Use `crabbox providers recommend web-app-smoke` when app or service smoke
   tests need provider-native URLs, SSH tunnels, tailnet reachability,
   browser/code/desktop access, sessions, or retained outputs.
3. Add live smoke docs where credentials are required.
   Provider adapters can be valuable before broad live access exists, but each
   one needs an opt-in smoke contract that says what real behavior proves. See
   [Provider live smoke](provider-live-smoke.md) for the shared contract. Use
   `crabbox providers recommend live-smoke` to pick candidates from offline
   lifecycle, sync, cleanup, and evidence metadata before spending capacity.
   Use `crabbox providers recommend cost-control` when a workflow should prefer
   local runtimes, coordinator governance, cleanup, cache reuse, or retained
   proof before spending provider quota.
   Use `crabbox providers recommend offline-validation` when live provider
   credentials or quota are not available yet; it prefers local runtimes,
   local sandboxes/VMs, BYO SSH hosts, and external-provider contracts over
   cloud API-backed leases.
   Use `crabbox providers recommend pause-resume` when long-running sandbox or
   dev-environment state needs to be parked and resumed.
   Use `crabbox providers recommend warm-start` when repeated runs should
   prefer local runtimes, reusable caches, retained sessions, pause/resume, or
   workspace-state signals before paying remote cold-start cost.
4. Strengthen workspace reuse before runtime-specific forking.
   Checkpoint, fork, restore, and provider snapshot semantics should be testable
   through the CLI before adding live microVM fan-out. Use
   `crabbox providers recommend workspace-reuse` as the workflow entry point
   when the operator cares about reusable state more than a specific fork API.
   Use `crabbox providers recommend fanout-testing` when the workflow needs
   parallel branch or best-of-N experimentation from forkable state.
5. Keep edge/worker execution separate from Linux sandboxes.
   A Worker module runtime is not the same thing as a Linux shell. Make the
   target and feature names say that clearly.

## Add-Provider Bar

Add a first-class provider when the PR can prove:

- stable lifecycle: create, inspect, run or attach, release, cleanup;
- honest `ProviderSpec.Kind`, category, targets, and feature flags;
- documented auth from env/config, never command-line secrets;
- offline tests for parsing, command construction, status/list rendering, and
  provider errors;
- opt-in live smoke when credentials or quota are required;
- docs that explain when to use the provider and when to choose an existing
  workflow instead.

If the bar is not met, use `ssh` or `external` and document the manual contract.
